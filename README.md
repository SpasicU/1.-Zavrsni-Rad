Final year project web page built using PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and MySql.

During this project i learned a lot about CSS and designing a website, i tried to implement designs that i liked and looked professional. Example pics:

I also learned CRUD operation's, and had fun with building admin panel and user profile. I relied on PHP and JavaScript to manipulate MySql database (PHPMyAdmin) and provide data to both admin and user, i also made sure they can manipulate the data.

All in all this project was a good learning experience. I learned a ton about front-end and back-end web development, and i proved to myself that i can build a website from scratch.
